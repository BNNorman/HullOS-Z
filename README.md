# HULLOS-X
Latest Connected Little Boxes software with Raspberry PI PICO and RFID support.

This is a snapshot of a work in progress. You can build it for ESP8266, ESP32 or Raspberry Pi PICO (just edit the palatform.ini file).

Edit the defaults.hsec file in the src folder to enter your Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials if you want to set a default configuration for all the boxes you build. Otherwise you can use the interactive commands or the web configuration tool to set up your box. 

You can find documentation for the Connected Little Boxes platform [here](https://github.com/connected-little-boxes/box-doc).

This is an ongoing project. Keep coming back for more stuff. 

Have fun
